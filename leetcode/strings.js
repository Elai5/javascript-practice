// what if we use nested loop,  first off, i would check which word is the longest, then, 
// identify lenght of both words
// initiate i, check if i is great than length of word 1,then add the first letter then run the inner loop j, add the index 0, thne go back to the firt loop add the second
//input size increases,run time increases.
